# CryptoMSG
Crypt Messages with key and POST&amp;READ over usenet.

Soon we will launch official BETA as web service so stay tuned:)

Meanwhile see how it works - http://i.imgur.com/BRCFEHD.gif

You do NOT need any usenet account.

Send POST command to our server -> Generate Key -> Crypt with generated key -> POST to USENET -> Echo the results

Send READ command to our server -> Read ARTICLE from USENET -> DeCrypt with your key -> Echo the results

CURRENT CRYPT MODE : AES 256 CBC
CURRENT KEY        : 256bit

WE DO NOT LOG ANYTHING :)
